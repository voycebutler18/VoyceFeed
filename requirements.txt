### Installation Steps

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Playwright browsers:**
   ```bash
   playwright install chromium
   ```

3. **Set your OpenAI API key:**
   
   **On Windows:**
   ```cmd
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **On Mac/Linux:**
   ```bash

   ```
   
   **Or create a .env file:**
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Update the profile URL in the bot:**
   Edit `improved_bot.py` and change:
   ```python
   FACEBOOK_PROFILE_URL = 'https://www.facebook.com/voyce.butler'
   ```
   to your actual Facebook profile URL.

### Running the Analyzer

1. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   python improved_bot.py
   ```

2. **Login process:**
   - A browser window will open
   - Log in to Facebook manually when prompted
   - The bot will save your session for future use
   - Wait for the analysis to complete

3. **View results:**
   - Check the console output
   - Results are also saved to `facebook_analysis_results.txt`
   - Logs are saved to `analysis_log.txt`

### Troubleshooting

**If scraping fails:**
- Make sure you're logged into Facebook
- Check if Facebook has updated their HTML structure
- Try running with headless=False to see what's happening
- Check the logs in `analysis_log.txt`

**If you get API errors:**
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Check your OpenAI account has credits
- Ensure the API key has the right permissions

**If login doesn't work:**
- Delete `facebook_session.json` and try again
- Make sure you complete the login within 60 seconds
- Check for any Facebook security prompts

### Important Notes

- The first run requires manual login
- Subsequent runs will use the saved session
- Facebook may occasionally require re-authentication
- The bot respects Facebook's rate limits
- Results are saved locally for your review
